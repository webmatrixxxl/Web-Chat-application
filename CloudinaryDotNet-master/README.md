## Try it right away

Sign up for a [free account](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) so you can try out image transformations and seamless image delivery through CDN.

*Note: Replace `demo` in all the following examples with your Cloudinary's `cloud name`.*  

Accessing an uploaded image with the `sample` public ID through a CDN:

    http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/sample.jpg

![Sample](https://cloudinary-a.akamaihd.net/demo/image/upload/w_0.4/sample.jpg "Sample")

Generating a 150x100 version of the `sample` image and downloading it through a CDN:

    http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_150,h_100,c_fill/sample.jpg

![Sample 150x100](https://cloudinary-a.akamaihd.net/demo/image/upload/w_150,h_100,c_fill/sample.jpg "Sample 150x100")

Converting to a 150x100 PNG with rounded corners of 20 pixels: 

    http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_150,h_100,c_fill,r_20/sample.png

![Sample 150x150 Rounded PNG](https://cloudinary-a.akamaihd.net/demo/image/upload/w_150,h_100,c_fill,r_20/sample.png "Sample 150x150 Rounded PNG")

For plenty more transformation options, see our [image transformations documentation](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations).

Generating a 120x90 thumbnail based on automatic face detection of the Facebook profile picture of Bill Clinton:
 
    http://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/facebook/c_thumb,g_face,h_90,w_120/billclinton.jpg
    
![Facebook 90x120](https://cloudinary-a.akamaihd.net/demo/image/facebook/c_thumb,g_face,h_90,w_120/billclinton.jpg "Facebook 90x200")

For more details, see our documentation for embedding [Facebook](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/facebook_profile_pictures) and [Twitter](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/twitter_profile_pictures) profile pictures.

## Usage

### Configuration

Each request for building a URL of a remote cloud resource must have the `cloud_name` parameter set. 
Each request to our secure APIs (e.g., image uploads, eager sprite generation) must have the `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters set. 
See [API, URLs and access identifiers](http://cloudinary.com/documentation/api_and_access_identifiers) for more details.

Setting the `cloud_name`, `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters can be done either directly in each call to a Cloudinary method, 
by when initializing the Cloudinary object, or by using the CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable / system property.

The main entry point of the library is the Cloudinary object.

    CloudinaryDotNet.Cloudinary cloudinary = new CloudinaryDotNet.Cloudinary();

NOTE: This call assumes that CLOUDINARY_URL environment variable is set. If not, please use parameterized constructor:

	CloudinaryDotNet.Account account =
		new CloudinaryDotNet.Account("my_cloud_name", "my_api_key", "my_api_secret");
	
	CloudinaryDotNet.Cloudinary cloudinary = new CloudinaryDotNet.Cloudinary(account);

### Embedding and transforming images

Any image uploaded to Cloudinary can be transformed and embedded using powerful view helper methods:

The following example generates the url for accessing an uploaded `sample` image while transforming it to fill a 100x150 rectangle:

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.Transform(new CloudinaryDotNet.Transformation().Width(100).Height(150).Crop("fill")).BuildUrl("sample.jpg");

Another example, emedding a smaller version of an uploaded image while generating a 90x90 face detection based thumbnail: 

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.Transform(new CloudinaryDotNet.Transformation().Width(90).Height(90).Crop("thumb").Gravity("face")).BuildUrl("woman.jpg");

You can provide either a Facebook name or a numeric ID of a Facebook profile or a fan page.  
             
Embedding a Facebook profile to match your graphic design is very simple:

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.Action("facebook").Transform(new CloudinaryDotNet.Transformation().Width(130).Height(130).Crop("fill").Gravity("north_west")).BuildUrl("billclinton.jpg");
                           
Same goes for Twitter:

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.Action("twitter_name").BuildUrl("billclinton.jpg");

### Upload

Assuming you have your Cloudinary configuration parameters defined (`cloud_name`, `api_key`, `api_secret`), uploading to Cloudinary is very simple.
    
The following example uploads a local JPG to the cloud: 
    
    CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadParams uploadParams = new CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadParams()
	{
		File = new CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.FileDescription(@"c:\mypicture.jpg")
	};
	
	CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadResult uploadResult = cloudinary.Upload(uploadParams);
        
The uploaded image is assigned a randomly generated public ID. The image is immediately available for download through a CDN:

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.BuildUrl(String.Format("{0}.{1}", uploadResult.PublicId, uploadResult.Format));
        
    http://res.cloudinary.com/cloud_name/image/upload/biricaezlhduexarhzsb.jpg

You can also specify your own public ID:    
    
    CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadParams uploadParams = new CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadParams()
	{
		File = new CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.FileDescription(@"c:\mypicture.jpg"),
		PublicId = "sample_remote_file"
	};
	
	CloudinaryDotNet.Actions.ImageUploadResult uploadResult = cloudinary.Upload(uploadParams);

    string url = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.BuildUrl("sample_remote_file.jpg");

    http://res.cloudinary.com/cloud_name/image/upload/sample_remote_file.jpg
        
### imageTag

Returns an html image tag pointing to Cloudinary.

Usage:

    string tag = cloudinary.Api.UrlImgUp.Format("png").Transform(new CloudinaryDotNet.Transformation().Width(100).Height(100).Crop("fill")).BuildImageTag("sample");

	# <img src='http://res.cloudinary.com/cloud_name/image/upload/c_fill,h_100,w_100/sample.png' width='100' height='100'/>
